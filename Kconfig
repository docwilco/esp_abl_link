            When enabled, Link uses ASIO's blocking run() which waits for socket
            events via lwIP's select(). This is more CPU efficient as the task
            sleeps when there's no network activity.

            When disabled, Link uses a timer-based polling approach that wakes
            the task periodically (every 1ms) to check for events. This is the
            original approach and is known to work, but wastes CPU cycles.
