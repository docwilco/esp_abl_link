            Select which CPU core to run Link tasks on.

            -1: No affinity (tskNO_AFFINITY) - FreeRTOS schedules on any core
             0: Core 0 - Note that WiFi also runs on core 0, which may cause contention
             1: Core 1 - Recommended to avoid contention with WiFi

            This option is only available when FREERTOS_UNICORE is not enabled.
